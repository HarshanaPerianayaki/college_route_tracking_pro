📍 Campus QR-Based Navigation System – St. Joseph’s College of Engineering

A smart, web-based navigation system designed to assist visitors, students, and event participants in easily locating places and event venues inside the campus using QR codes and Google Maps navigation.

🚀 Project Overview

Traditional printed campus maps are hard to maintain, costly to update, and often cause confusion for new visitors.
This project solves those problems by providing a digital, interactive, and GPS-powered navigation system.

Visitors simply scan a QR code placed at campus entry points.
They are then redirected to an online interface where they can:

Select Event or Place

Choose their destination

Get real-time Google Maps navigation from the campus entrance
